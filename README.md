# My Portfolio
Enclosed in this repository are my projects so far in Python and C++ (in progress). 

## February 2025 - Measuring Drop Spread Law (Python, Jupyter Notebook) 
Project in second year undergraduate involving cleaning and analysing experimental data of the radial spread of a droplet over time. Useful physical quantities were extracted from the data and models were fitted, involving presentation of plots, simple animation and error/chi-squared analysis.  

## March 2025 - Numerical Integration (Python, Jupyter Notebook)  
Project in second year undergraduate which sought to compare the efficiency and accuracy of four different numerical integration methods, including Euler, Improved-Euler, Verlet and Euler-Cromer. The most efficient of these was found and used to find the solution to a differential equation damped oscillator problem. Presentation of plots, chi-squared analysis and simple animations used.  

## May 2025 - Monte Carlo Techniques - Neutron Scattering (Python, Jupyter Notebook)
Project in second year undergraduate including simulating neutron scatter through materials via Monte Carlo techniques. Calculation of transmission rates for water, lead and graphite as a function of width. Use of the Woodcock method for simulating boundary interactions.
